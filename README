Anime Recommendation System (ARS) v0.2

**************************************************************************
SUMMARY
**************************************************************************
Anime has become a very trending topic these days with so many people watching it and others
catching up to it. It has garnered a lot of attention but sometimes people get lost in the sea of anime
available and often watch something that doesn’t interest them. Our system aims to solve this issue by
catering to both viewers who are just exploring anime and to patrons who have acquired a taste for it.
For new users, the system predicts the shows they can watch based on the genres they prefer, the
number of episodes etc. For seasoned viewers, the system takes their top anime shows as input and
based on their genre and rating, suggests a new list of shows that they will enjoy. This provides the
viewers a user-friendly mechanism to filter and find shows which will suit their interests
